### Boundedness Theorem 有界性定理  
\[Pugh 2015\] / 22 Theorem  
  
> Proof - Sketch  
> 1 we claim c = the Least Upper Bound of the set { x ∈ \[a,b\] : f(x) is bounded on \[a,x\] }  
> 2 we claim f(x) is bounded on \[a,c\] **NOTE since c can equal b, if the interval \[a,b\] were half-open \[a,b), we would have f(x) may not be continuous at c by applying b to c**  
> 3 we claim c = b
